# Demo Prototype - we need your input! 

We are launching a prototype API with a simple web interface (demonstration purposes only) to encourage early input and participation.

Please review the white papers on the GLOBAL CHEMICAL RESOLVER and the CHEMICAL STRUCTURE VALIDATOR, test the demo web prototype and provide feedback.
