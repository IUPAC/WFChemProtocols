    "One key point of this proposal is that the base URL for the resolver CGI would vary from one institution to another, but the inputs (CGI arguments) and outputs (JSON data) would be standard, the same for any organization implementing the service.

That is, when a user inputs a SMILES string or an SDF file (for example, as export from some chemical drawing package or ELN), does the host organization confirm that the structure is valid? Does it have the right number of defined stereocenters, isotopes, etc.? Sometimes chemists draw complex structures in a way where stereochemistry is implied by the drawing, but may not be interpreted as such by a machine. This tool will allow the chemist to verify that the structure is perceived by the chemical software in the same way as by the chemist themselves.\n",

So the resolver can also return an image file, with an appropriate output format request. Note, in order to show the image here in the notebook, we must use the resolver URL in the image tag directly, rather than going through python."

    "It is our hope this this notebook provides a clear overview of the expected functionality of the resolver being proposed by this IUPAC project. These working examples should give the user a chance to see how to submit these web service requests, without having to know any programming, and to be able to change the inputs with their own SMILES strings etc. in order to see how the resolver responds to their unique cases.\n",
