# WorldFAIR Chemistry: Protocol Services

## Description

This project corresponds to Deliverable 3.3 of the WorldFAIR Chemistry project. The main scope of work will be to define a common protocol for resolving different chemical representations. The specification will articulate a shared data model for chemical information exchange through an API that can be implemented by any system that manages chemical records. Users will be able to query registered resources with different scopes and capabilities at a general level to determine where they can find additional data and information. The model will cover a range of chemical representations, including structural diagrams, nomenclature and other linear notations. The protocol will also provide a standard set of error codes for flagging ambiguous or conflicting representations.


## Objective

Representing chemical substances in structure form is one of the most critical functions in communicating chemistry, including sharing FAIR and machine-readable chemical data, as many resources are indexed by chemical structures. There are a range of approaches for articulating chemical substance information, depending on the scientific nature and context, and the digital motifs used in chemical databases and chemicals software, present additional layers of complexity. Chemical interpretation can vary between data systems and directly impact downstream reuse, especially when it comes to representation and analysis of associated data. Validation of chemical description is an essential requirement for the re-usability of chemical data, including discovery and in many modeling and predictive AI/ML applications.

This project aims to develop the specification for a web-based service that confirms chemical identity and provides real-time feedback on the machine-readability of chemical data and metadata representation, based on IUPAC standard rule sets and recommended best practices.
